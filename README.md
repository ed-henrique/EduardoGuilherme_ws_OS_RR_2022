## References

Most of the code regarding graphs was inspired by this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQmlXAwUvZ4).

Most of the code regarding DFS using multithreading was adapted from this [Github Repo](https://github.com/Raafm/algorithm_visualization/blob/main/multithreadDFS.py).
